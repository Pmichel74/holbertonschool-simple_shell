# SIMPLE_SHELL(1) User Commands SIMPLE_SHELL(1)

## NAME
simple_shell - simple command line interpreter

## SYNOPSIS
**simple_shell**

## DESCRIPTION
simple_shell is a basic command line interpreter that executes commands read from standard input. It implements a subset of the functionality found in traditional Unix shells.

### Interactive Mode
When simple_shell is invoked without arguments and with its input connected to a terminal, it runs in interactive mode. In this mode, it displays a prompt (`$`) and waits for user input.

### Non-Interactive Mode
When simple_shell is invoked with standard input not connected to a terminal, it reads and executes commands without displaying a prompt.

## COMMAND EXECUTION
The shell executes commands in the following order:

1. The command line is read and split into words using space, tab, and newline as delimiters
2. If the command starts with a `/` or `./`, it is treated as an absolute or relative path
3. Otherwise, the shell searches for the command in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable
4. Built-in commands are executed directly by the shell
5. External commands are executed in a new process

## BUILTINS
The following built-in commands are supported:

* **exit [status]**  
  Exit the shell. If status is specified, it is used as the exit status; otherwise, the exit status of the last command is used.

* **env**  
  Print the current environment variables.

* **setenv VARIABLE VALUE**  
  Set an environment variable.

* **unsetenv VARIABLE**  
  Remove an environment variable.

## ENVIRONMENT
The shell uses the following environment variables:

* **PATH**  
  A colon-separated list of directories to search for commands.

## EXIT STATUS
The shell returns the exit status of the last command executed, or 127 if the command was not found.

## EXAMPLES
Run a command:
```
$ ls -l
```

Set an environment variable:
```
$ setenv MY_VAR hello
```

Exit with specific status:
```
$ exit 2
```

## SIGNALS
The shell handles the following signals:

* **SIGINT (Ctrl-C)**  
  Interrupts the current foreground command.

## FILES
No configuration files are used.
