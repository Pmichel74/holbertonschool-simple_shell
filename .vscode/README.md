<h1>Simple Shell</h1>

## Introduction

### What is Shell
A shell is a command-line interface that acts as an intermediary between the user and the operating system kernel. It interprets user commands, either interactively (typed directly into the terminal) or non-interactively (read from a script), and translates them into system calls that the operating system can understand and execute.

### What is it for
A lightweight UNIX command interpreter that executes commands from standard input. Built in C as part of the Holberton School curriculum, this shell implements core features like command execution with arguments, environment variable handling, and essential built-in commands.

### Tasks

*  README, man, AUTHORS.
*  Write a beautiful code that passes the Betty checks.
*  Write a UNIX command line interpreter.
*  Handle command lines with arguments.
*  Handle the PATH.
*  Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell.
*  Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment.
